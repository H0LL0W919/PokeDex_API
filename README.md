# PokeDex_API_Git
 A PokeDex Program using PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co)

 Student project for Programming Application Programming Interfaces (PRAPI), learning how to work with APIs

 This project contains a PokeDex system.
 The user can manually search via a user input field.
 The program contains an autocomplete dropdown system, where it'll provide the name of the Pokemon it thinks you're searching for.
 There is however, a bug with the dropdown.  Unity won't allow you to select the first option, so the user must type out the name in full, or select options 2 - 10.
 The program also contains a move display system, showing you all the moves a Pokemon has access to and colour coordinates them based on type.
 There is also a comparison button that opens a new scene and lets you directly compare two pokemon, showing their base stats/names and types.

 Using this software requires an internet connection, as it dynamically pulls the information from the web in a json format.

 PokeAPI is a fan made API that relies on contriubutors to extend the database, so it's only natural that data will be missing as there are #1025 pokemon. 
 As of making this, encounter info was only available up to Pokemon #804

 I had a lot of fun making this and will definitely be improving this system in the future! :)
